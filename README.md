## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The portfolio embraces a **dark luxury tech aesthetic** — a deliberate choice to reflect the precision and sophistication that Ted brings to his work. Key design decisions include:

- **Color palette** drawn from his personal "K" logo — electric blue (`#3b82f6`), violet (`#a855f7`), and magenta (`#ec4899`)
- **Playfair Display** for headings — authoritative and refined
- **DM Sans** for body text — clean, modern, and highly legible
- **Gradient mesh orbs** and a CSS grid background for depth and atmosphere
- **Scroll-triggered animations** to reveal content progressively and keep users engaged
